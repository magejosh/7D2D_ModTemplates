7D2D Mod Templates is a collection of easy-to-use templates for adding new things to the game [7 Days To Die](https://store.steampowered.com/app/251570/7_Days_to_Die/) by The Fun Pimps. 

This project is born out of love for the game and appreciation for how easy the developers have made it to mod things into the game. The aim is to help new modders learn their way around faster.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/magejosh/7D2D_ModTemplates.git```

2. Open the project in your favorite code editor and start modding!

Usage
Each of the template mods in this project are sorted to their respective Alpha release. The intention is that you will copy the template you want to use and then open it in your editing program of choice (VSCode is the best, you can make it work just like Notebook++, j/k use what works for you) and follow the instructions in the comments of each xml file. The find and replace method will be done on the localization.txt files as well. Don't forget to change the ModInfo.xml file as well so it's your mod.
